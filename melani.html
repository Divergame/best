    <h1>Melani Yañez Navia <i class="fa-solid fa-heart" style="color: #e75480;"></i></h1>


    <p>Melani likes to go to the gym, she's very strong and knows boxing. She also likes to listen to music while she
        washes the dishes. She knows how to play the guitar, but she doesn't have a guitar.</p>


    <p>She shows me many artists, such as: José José, Laufey, Mon Laferte, David Me Estás Matando, K-pop and many Asian
        artists. She also calls me "Migajero", but I'm not a migajero (I'm a different person today).</p>


    <p>We usually call each other when we have time to talk about different things, such as our lives, our problems, our
        future, and many more things. I love her so much, she's like a sister to me.</p>


    <p>Sometimes I behave badly with her. I usually tease her, I call her "Nusita", "Black", "Night" and other things,
        but she doesn't care because she knows I love her very much<i class="fa-solid fa-heart"
            style="color: #ff0000;"></i>.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>


    <p>We have an interesting history. We met in a guitar course at UAB during vacation. We didn't talk too much,
        because I've always been a little shy. She was friendly with me and we started to talk about the guitar and
        music.</p>

    <p>After that, we started to talk more and more, we started to share our problems and our lives. We started to share
        our music and our interests.</p>

    <p>Until our performance, she gave me her Instagram and I wrote in my phone "melani navia". After the performance
        and I went back to my house, I wrote her name on Instagram, but I couldn't find her. I had no idea which was her
        username and the right profile. I lost her at that moment.</p>


    <p>After one year, I went to an event and it was boring, but I saw how the governor gave cellphones and other things
        that I wanted. I decided to move to the front and one person greeted me, I didn't know who that person was, that
        person, I didn't remember her, but she was Melani. I was surprised, I didn't know that she was there. We started
        to talk and we started to share our life again.</p>


    <p>After the event ended, I asked for her instagram again. This time, she showed me her right profile and I wrote it
        in my phone. I was so happy and we stared to talked again.</p>


    <p>The only photo that I have with her is this one:</p>

    <img src="img/photo.jpg" alt="Foto" width="300">

    <p>We took this until we had a performance in the UAB, we were so nervous, but we did it.</p>
    <p>I love you Melani, you're one of my best friends and I will always be there to support you in everything you do.
        You know that I love you so much <i class="fa-solid fa-heart" style="color: #ff0000;"></i>.</p>
        <p>If you are tired or sadness, you can call me and it's possible for me. I'll huge you and tell you that
        everything is going to be okay, because I love you so much <i class="fa-solid fa-heart"
            style="color: #ff0000;"></i>.</p>
